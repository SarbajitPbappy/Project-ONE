# üåè Bangladesh Population Analysis Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project delves into the intricate tapestry of Bangladesh's population statistics, aiming to bridge linguistic barriers by translating Bengali names into English for global accessibility. Leveraging advanced SQL queries, the study conducts extensive data analysis to unveil insights into demographic trends, urbanization patterns, and population density dynamics. By scrutinizing diverse datasets, this research sheds light on the multifaceted aspects of Bangladesh's population dynamics, offering valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders.
## üõ† Tools and Technologies

- **SQL:** Leveraging SQL to manipulate and query a comprehensive dataset.
- **Python Pandas:** Utilized for initial data transformation, particularly for translating Bengali names to English.
# Citation
This project utilizes data from various sources, including the Kaggle dataset "Bangladesh Districts Wise Population" ([Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msjahid/bangladesh-districts-wise-population)), acknowledging contributions from academic, governmental, and public data repositories. The data transformation and analysis methodologies are inspired by contemporary research and datasets available on platforms like Kaggle.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains comprehensive information about various cities in Bangladesh, including their population statistics across different years. Analyzing this dataset offers valuable insights into the demographic trends, urban development, and population dynamics within Bangladesh.

## Dataset Overview
- **Source:** The data was scraped from the webpages [City Population](https://www.citypopulation.de/en/bangladesh/cities/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Bangladesh).
- **Content:** The dataset contains information about cities in Bangladesh, including their names, population, and other relevant demographic data.
- **Format:** The data is presented in a tabular format within an HTML table on the webpage.

## üîë Key Features
- **Cities:** Encompasses a diverse range of cities across Bangladesh, representing different regions, sizes, and administrative statuses.
- **Population Trends:** Data provided for multiple years, spanning from 1991 to 2022, allowing for longitudinal analysis of population growth, migration patterns, and urbanization trends over time.
- **Geographical Information:** Includes details about the geographical area of each city in square kilometers, providing context for population density and spatial distribution.
- **City Status:** Categorizes cities based on their administrative status, such as urban, rural, or special administrative regions, offering insights into the urban-rural divide and administrative structures within Bangladesh.
- **Native Names:** Includes native or local names of cities, reflecting the linguistic and cultural diversity of Bangladesh.
- **Administrative Divisions:** Information about the division to which each city belongs, offering insights into the administrative structure of Bangladesh.
## üìä Dataset Insights

The dataset, `city_population_translated`, undergoes a series of SQL queries designed to reveal intricate patterns and trends:

### üîÑ Data Translation and Cleanup

```sql
-- Renaming columns for clarity and accessibility
ALTER TABLE `city_population_translated` 
CHANGE COLUMN `Abbr.` abbreviation VARCHAR(255),
CHANGE COLUMN `Area(Km^2)` Area VARCHAR(255);
```
### üìà District and Division Insights

The first query aims to enumerate and sort the districts within each division by their count, providing a clear picture of the distribution of administrative areas within the country:

```sql

-- Count and sort districts within each division

SELECT Division, COUNT(Name) AS Districts_Count

FROM city_population_translated

GROUP BY Division

ORDER BY COUNT(Name) DESC;

```

### üìàPopulation Growth and Density

To understand the dynamics of population change over a decade, this query calculates the growth rate from 1991 to 2001 for each district. This analysis is pivotal in identifying areas with significant demographic shifts:

```sql

-- Calculate growth rate from 1991 to 2001 for each district

SELECT Name AS District, Division, Population_2001, Population_1991,

((Population_2001 - Population_1991) / Population_1991) * 100 AS Growth_Rate_Percent

FROM city_population_translated

ORDER BY Growth_Rate_Percent DESC;

```

### üåçGeographical Analysis

A key aspect of urban planning and development is understanding the geographical spread of districts. By sorting the districts based on their area, this query highlights the scale of each district, providing insights into population density and land use:

```sql

-- Sort districts by area, casting the area to Decimal for accuracy

SELECT Name AS District, CAST(Area AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Area

FROM city_population_translated

ORDER BY CAST(Area AS DECIMAL(10,2)) ASC;

```
# üîëKey Findings
- **Urban Expansion:** Analysis shows significant growth in specific districts, underscoring urban sprawl.
- **Population Density:** Several regions have surpassed the threshold of 16 people per square kilometer, highlighting areas of potential overpopulation.
- **Demographic Shifts:** The growth rate analysis between 1991 and 2001 provides insights into demographic changes, vital for future urban planning and resource allocation.

# üéØConclusion and Future Directions
This project lays the foundation for further demographic studies in Bangladesh, offering a gateway to predictive modeling and more nuanced analyses. Future directions could include integrating socio-economic factors, exploring migration patterns, and employing machine learning for predictive insights.
